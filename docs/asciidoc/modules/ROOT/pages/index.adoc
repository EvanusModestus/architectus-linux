== Approach

Every guide follows these principles:

1. **Concepts first** — understand the "why" before the "how"
2. **Multi-distro** — commands for {distro-arch}, {distro-rhel}, {distro-debian}
3. **Verification** — always confirm before and after changes
4. **Security by default** — principle of least privilege

== Distribution Coverage

This documentation covers multiple distributions with tabbed examples:

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Distribution |Package Manager |Use Case

|{distro-arch}
|{pkg-arch}
|Rolling release, bleeding edge, personal workstations

|{distro-rhel}
|{pkg-rhel}
|Enterprise servers, long-term support, compliance

|{distro-debian}
|{pkg-debian}
|Stable servers, containers, broad hardware support

|{distro-fedora}
|{pkg-rhel}
|Workstations, testing RHEL-bound features

== Enterprise Experience

This documentation reflects real-world implementation experience:

* **802.1X / Network Access Control** — Production deployments with Cisco ISE, certificate-based authentication for Linux endpoints in enterprise environments
* **PKI Integration** — End-to-end certificate lifecycle: enrollment, deployment, renewal, revocation
* **systemd Architecture** — Service dependencies, boot ordering, failure handling for authentication services
* **Troubleshooting** — Battle-tested solutions from production incident response

The patterns here come from solving real problems, not theoretical exercises.
