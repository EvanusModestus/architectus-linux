== Approach

Every guide follows these principles:

1. **Concepts first** — understand the "why" before the "how"
2. **Multi-distro** — commands for {distro-arch}, {distro-rhel}, {distro-debian}
3. **Verification** — always confirm before and after changes
4. **Security by default** — principle of least privilege

== Distribution Coverage

This documentation covers multiple distributions with tabbed examples:

|{distro-arch}
|{pkg-arch}
|Rolling release, bleeding edge, personal workstations

|{distro-rhel}
|{pkg-rhel}
|Enterprise servers, long-term support, compliance

|{distro-debian}
|{pkg-debian}
|Stable servers, containers, broad hardware support

|{distro-fedora}
|{pkg-rhel}
|Workstations, testing RHEL-bound features
