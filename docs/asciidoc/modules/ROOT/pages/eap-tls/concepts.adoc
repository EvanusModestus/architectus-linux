:description: Understanding 802.1X architecture, EAP methods, and why EAP-TLS is the strongest choice
:navtitle: Concepts

802.1X is the IEEE standard for port-based network access control. Before a device gets network access, it must authenticate.

== EAP Methods Compared

Not all EAP methods are equal. Choose based on security requirements.

[cols="1,1,1,1,2"]
|===
|Method |Client Cert |Server Cert |Credentials |Security Assessment

|**EAP-TLS**
|Yes
|Yes
|None (cert-based)
|Strongest. Mutual authentication. No passwords to steal.

|**PEAP-MSCHAPv2**
|No
|Yes
|Username/password
|Common but weaker. Password hashes can be cracked.

|**EAP-TTLS**
|Optional
|Yes
|Username/password
|Similar to PEAP. Tunneled authentication.

|**EAP-FAST**
|Optional
|Yes
|PAC or password
|Cisco proprietary. PAC provisioning complexity.

|**MAB**
|No
|No
|MAC address
|Not EAP. Fallback only. Trivially spoofed.
|===

== Why EAP-TLS?

EAP-TLS is the only method that eliminates password-based attacks entirely.

=== Advantages

* **Mutual authentication** — both client and server prove identity via certificates
* **No passwords** — nothing to phish, crack, or stuff
* **Device identity** — certificate binds to specific machine
* **Instant revocation** — compromised cert revoked in seconds
* **Meets compliance** — required by many security frameworks

=== Trade-offs

* **PKI required** — need certificate infrastructure
* **Enrollment complexity** — certificates must be provisioned to endpoints
* **Renewal process** — certificates expire, automation required

The trade-offs are operational, not security. If you can manage the PKI, EAP-TLS is always the right choice.

== Certificate Requirements

=== Server Certificate (RADIUS)

The authentication server presents this certificate to prove its identity.

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Attribute |Requirement

|Subject
|FQDN of RADIUS server

|SAN
|DNS name of RADIUS server

|EKU
|Server Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1)

|Key Usage
|Digital Signature, Key Encipherment

|Validity
|1-3 years typical
|===

=== Client Certificate (Supplicant)

The endpoint presents this certificate to prove its identity.

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Attribute |Requirement

|Subject
|Hostname or machine identifier

|SAN
|DNS name, optionally UPN

|EKU
|Client Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2)

|Key Usage
|Digital Signature

|Validity
|1 year typical
|===

=== CA Certificate (Trust Anchor)

Both sides must trust a common CA.

* RADIUS server trusts CA that issued client certs
* Client trusts CA that issued RADIUS server cert
* Often the same CA, but can be different

== VLAN Assignment

After successful authentication, the RADIUS server can push attributes to the switch:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Attribute |Purpose

|Tunnel-Type
|VLAN (value: 13)

|Tunnel-Medium-Type
|802 (value: 6)

|Tunnel-Private-Group-ID
|VLAN ID or name

|Filter-Id
|ACL name to apply

|Cisco-AVPair
|Vendor-specific (dACL, SGT, etc.)
|===

This enables dynamic segmentation — the network decides where to place the device based on identity, not physical port.

== Linux Supplicant Options

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Tool |Use Case |Notes

|**wpa_supplicant**
|Direct control, systemd integration
|Most flexible. Required for EAP-TLS wired.

|**NetworkManager**
|Desktop convenience
|Uses wpa_supplicant backend. Good for GUI.

|**systemd-networkd**
|Server/minimal systems
|Limited 802.1X support. Avoid for EAP-TLS.
|===

For EAP-TLS on Linux, wpa_supplicant is the foundation regardless of which front-end you use.
